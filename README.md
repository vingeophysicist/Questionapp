**Description:**

This web application is built using a combination of React and Django. React and Material UI is used on the frontend, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface, while Django serves as the backend framework for handling data processing and database management.

**Features:**

React frontend: Utilizes the React library to build the user interface and manage the application's state.

Django backend: Employs the Django framework to handle server-side logic, data management, and API endpoints.

RESTful API: The frontend communicates with the backend through a RESTful API, allowing data exchange and synchronization between the client and server.

Database integration: Connects to a database (PostgreSQL ) to store and retrieve data.

Authentication and authorization: Implements user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system or third-party libraries such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Frontend routing: Utilizes React Router or similar libraries to enable client-side routing and handle navigation within the application.

Responsive design: Develops a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
